**A few things I've built outside work:**

### [ðŸŒ³ Family Tree Web App (Ongoing)](https://family-tree-indam.vercel.app/)
A web application to handle family tree visualization which some existing builder ones are unable to handle the non-standard family complexities (which are common in Indonesian families).

[Next.js 15 (Typescript) Â· Tailwind](https://github.com/indam-m/family-tree-app)

[Node.js (Express.js) Â· PostgreSQL Â· GraphQL](https://github.com/indam-m/family-tree-service-node)

### [ðŸ‘‹ Simple Dutch Greetings with Rust](https://github.com/indam-m/nl-rs-greetings)
